## Introduction

interoplate is a research project developed through a collaboration between Dr. Everett and Leif Huender at the University of Idaho's Computer Science Division. The project's objective is to explore and analyze the characteristics and similarities between microclimates and their effects on crop yield and malaria outbreaks globally.

interoplate comprises a suite of statistical and machine learning models, ranging from Random Forests to Transformers. The initiative is dedicated to advancing our understanding of microclimate impacts through rigorous analysis and model development.
