# Abstract

## Draft 1

This paper introduces a novel methodology employing high-dimensional temporal weather data to identify regions with similar microclimates. This method, leveraging machine learning techniques, marks a significant advance over traditional approaches by enhancing our understanding of both well-documented and lesser-known microclimates. It navigates challenges such as data sparsity and dimensionality through the use of similarity scoring metrics, Riemannian learning, and advanced transformer models. Unlike conventional methods that primarily focus on established microclimates, our approach also sheds light on previously underexplored areas. This improvement is not only needed for refining our understanding of microclimate intricacies but also expands the applicability of precision agriculture, enabling the prediction of agricultural outcomes in areas formerly considered data deficient. Our research analyzed data from four distinct microclimates using methods like Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Riemann manifold scoring to identify similarities, seasonal variations, and long-term climate trends. We developed and validated predictive models based on transformer neural network technology to assess the impact of climatic variables on crop yields across different seasons and locations. The findings demonstrate that these models significantly enhance prediction accuracy in regions with similar microclimates, thus providing farmers in data-sparse areas with valuable insights to make informed agricultural decisions. This study features the potential of utilizing large datasets to revolutionize farming, offering new avenues for improving crop yields and farming practices, particularly in regions previously constrained by insufficient data. The implications of this research are profound, both for understanding the influence of microclimates on agriculture and for equipping regions with the necessary tools to boost agricultural productivity.

## Draft 2

This study addresses the challenge of making accurate agricultural forecasts in microclimates using limited or noisy data. Our research focuses on the application of similarity comparison methods to analyze microclimate data streams, employing four distinct metrics: Geometric, Correlation, Information Theory, and Manifold comparisons. By analyzing ten different metrics across these methods, we identify the most insightful approaches for predicting crop yields in similar microclimates. We evaluate the effectiveness of these methods by comparing the accuracy of crop yield predictions. Further, we explore the utility of similarity scores in enhancing the resolution of machine learning models aimed at improving predictive accuracy. Our comparative analysis includes both direct predictive models and sequential models, trained without the use of similarity scores. The results indicate that pretraining models with similarity-scored knowledge significantly enhances prediction accuracy.
Building on these findings, we propose the development of a new 'mixture of experts' model that integrates similarity-scored metrics. This model aims to provide more accurate and granular predictions for regions characterized by sparse or noisy data. Our future work will focus on refining this model and extending its applicability to broader climate and microclimate contexts.


## Draft 3

This paper introduces an innovative methodology for enhancing the prediction accuracy of agricultural outcomes in microclimates characterized by sparse meteorological data. By leveraging high-dimensional temporal weather data from four distinct geographic regions in New Mexico (Otero, Sierra, Dona Ana, and Chaves) we employ advanced machine learning techniques, including similarity scoring metrics, Riemannian learning, and transformer models, to identify regions with analogous microclimates. This approach advances over traditional methods by improving dataset resolution and prediction robustness. It also facilitates the exploration of lesser-known microclimates. We apply a range of similarity metrics, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and geometric distances, to analyze seasonal variations and identify significant correlations across microclimates. These correlations enable the extrapolation of data-rich insights to enhance forecasts in data-sparse areas, thus addressing challenges of data deficiency and enhancing agricultural productivity. Our predictive models, which incorporate these similarity metrics, demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting crop yields, particularly in regions previously limited by insufficient data. Looking forward, we aim to develop a Mixture of Experts model that utilizes these insights to provide more precise and localized predictions. This research not only contributes to our understanding of microclimate influences on agriculture but also equips regions with the tools necessary for informed agricultural decision-making, aiming to improve the sustainability and efficiency of farming practices.

## Draft 5

This paper explores innovative methodologies for predicting agricultural outcomes in microclimates characterized by sparse meteorological data, employing high-dimensional temporal datasets from four geographic regions in New Mexicoâ€”Otero, Sierra, Dona Ana, and Chaves. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including similarity scoring metrics, Riemannian learning, and transformer models, our study enhances the understanding of both well-documented and lesser-known microclimates. We utilize various similarity metrics, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and geometric distances, to identify significant correlations across these microclimates, thereby improving the resolution of our datasets and the robustness of our predictions. This process enables the extrapolation of data-rich insights to enhance forecasts in areas previously constrained by data deficiencies. Our initial findings suggest that employing these methodologies may significantly improve the accuracy of crop yield predictions, especially in regions with limited data. Moving forward, we propose to refine these predictive models and explore a Mixture of Experts architecture to provide more precise and localized predictions across different agricultural regions. This research, still in its early stages, holds promise for revolutionizing forecasting practices in agriculture, potentially improving the sustainability and efficiency of farming practices without making conclusive statements at this juncture.
